    * `git push heroku master`
    * `heroku run bundle exec rake db:migrate` to run your migrations on heroku


  Gotchas:
  * Make sure you're using Postgres. Heroku doesn't support SQLite3.
  * `config.initialize_on_precompile = false` in config/application.rb
  * `ruby '2.1.1'` in your Gemfile
  * If you don't have the `heroku` terminal command, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
